 These are links to pages in the Notion repository "associated" with this site.
> Notion is a freemium productivity and note-taking web application developed by Notion Labs Inc. It offers organizational tools including task management, project tracking, to-do lists, bookmarking, and more.
 Using Notion allows extremely easy and robust page editing/formatting/proof/etc, and links can be shared for collaborative editing to anyone with a web browser. There are similar services to Notion that may be better suited to fulfilling its intended function on this site, but for now it is the default option. 
  Anyone with access to edit a Notion page linked below (which for now are organized by binary editable or not editable labels) is welcome to add to, edit, and remove information as they see fit, but keep in mind that there's no current version control in these pages (i.e. ability to recover removed information), so removing raw information entirely is not advised. The destiny of some of these Notion pages are to become static pages on this site, but for the time their home is in Notion.
